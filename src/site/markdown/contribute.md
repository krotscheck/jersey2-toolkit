# Contributing

We do not accept feature requests that do not include some kind of code.
Contributing to may be done in two ways:

##1: Write a unit test

We maintain a high standard of code coverage, however we know there are still
loopholes in our testing. If there is a bug that you've identified, 
please write the corresponding unit test and submit it as a patch to the 
project. We'll fix it for you.

##2: Submit a patch

If your request includes new functionality, please implement it and submit a 
patch against our repository, ensuring that our unit test, coverage, and 
formatting standards are met. We'll get to it as quickly as possible.
